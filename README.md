Some games from the book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 3rd Edition" written by AI Sweigart.

There are a number of small games in here, which I copied from the book I just mentioned and modified some of them.

The last game named "Dodger" is fun since it use Pygame library and I recommend it to you!

I will add more games in later days.
